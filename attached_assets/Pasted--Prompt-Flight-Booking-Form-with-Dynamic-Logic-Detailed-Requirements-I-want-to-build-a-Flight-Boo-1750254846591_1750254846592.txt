 Prompt: Flight Booking Form with Dynamic Logic (Detailed Requirements)
I want to build a Flight Booking Form with the following complete structure and logic. This form should work smoothly in tools like Fluent Forms, WS Form, Replit, or any visual/no-code environment that supports conditional logic.

✅ 1. Personal Information Section
Field Label	Type	Required?	Notes
Full Name	Text	✅	Label: “Full Name (Surname/Given Name)”

Phone Number	Phone	✅	With proper formatting

✅ 2. Flight Segments Selection
Field Label	Type	Required?	Options
How many flight segments?	Radio	✅	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Conditional Logic:
When a user selects a number, only that many Flight Segment Sections should appear.

✅ 3. Flight Segment Section (1–6)
For each flight segment, display the following fields:

Field Label	Type	Required?	Notes
Flight Number	Text	✅	Example: QR605

Date	Date	✅	Departure date
Departure Time	Time	✅	Time format (HH:MM)

Display Logic:
Each Flight Segment block (Flight 2–6) should be conditionally shown if user selects 2 or more, 3 or more, etc.

✅ 4. Passenger Selection
Field Label	Type	Required?	Options
How many passengers?	Radio	✅	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

For each passenger, display the following fields:

Field Label	Type	Required?	Notes

Baggage Options	Checkbox	❌	Options: Personal Bag, Hand Carry, Checked Bag
E-Ticket Number	Text	✅	Ticket number for the passenger

Display Logic:
Each Passenger block (Passenger 2–6) should be conditionally shown if user selects 2 or more, etc.

🔒 6. Consent Section
Field Label	Type	Required?
I agree to the booking terms and conditions	Checkbox	✅

💳 7. (Optional) Payment Section

🧠 Logic Summary
Uses radio buttons to select number of segments & passengers

Shows only the relevant flight or passenger fields

Supports baggage checkboxes, e-ticket inputs, date/time inputs

Form must be clean, responsive, and fully functional
